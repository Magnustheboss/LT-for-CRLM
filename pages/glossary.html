                        <h3>CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)</h3>
                        <p>A tumor marker protein produced by colorectal cancer cells. Elevated levels (typically > 5 ng/mL) suggest higher disease burden. Used in the Oslo Score (> 80 µg/L) and FCRS (> 200 ng/mL) for prognostic assessment.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>CRLM (Colorectal Liver Metastases)</h3>
                        <p>Secondary liver tumors that originate from colorectal cancer. Approximately 50% of colorectal cancer patients develop CRLM during their disease course. Can be synchronous (present at time of primary diagnosis) or metachronous (develop later).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>DFI (Disease-Free Interval)</h3>
                        <p>The time between resection of the primary colorectal tumor and detection of the first metastasis. A short DFI (< 12 months) indicates aggressive disease and is a risk factor in the FCRS.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>DFS (Disease-Free Survival)</h3>
                        <p>The length of time after treatment during which a patient survives without any sign of cancer recurrence. In CRLM patients after LT, median DFS is typically 11.8 months despite excellent overall survival.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance Status</h3>
                        <p>A scale (0-4) measuring patient functional status. ECOG 0 = fully active; ECOG 1 = restricted strenuous activity; ECOG 2+ = mostly bedbound. Patients with ECOG > 1 are generally not candidates for LT.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>HTL (High Tumor Load)</h3>
                        <p>Extensive liver metastases that would preclude standard liver resection. LT offers a curative option for HTL CRLM patients who would otherwise have no surgical option.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Metastasis / Metastatic Disease</h3>
                        <p>Cancer that has spread from the primary site to distant organs. In CRLM, the liver is the site of metastatic disease originating from the colon or rectum.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>OS (Overall Survival)</h3>
                        <p>The length of time from diagnosis or treatment start until death from any cause. The primary endpoint in most CRLM trials. LT + chemotherapy achieves 56.6% 5-year OS compared to 12.6% with chemotherapy alone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Progressive Disease</h3>
                        <p>Cancer that continues to grow despite treatment. In CRLM, progressive disease on chemotherapy is a risk factor (included in Oslo Score) indicating aggressive tumor biology.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Resectable vs. Unresectable</h3>
                        <p><strong>Resectable:</strong> Liver metastases that can be surgically removed while preserving adequate liver function. <strong>Unresectable:</strong> Metastases that cannot be removed due to extent, location, or patient factors. LT is indicated for permanently unresectable CRLM.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Synchronous vs. Metachronous</h3>
                        <p><strong>Synchronous CRLM:</strong> Liver metastases present at the time of primary colorectal cancer diagnosis. <strong>Metachronous CRLM:</strong> Liver metastases that develop after resection of the primary tumor.</p>

                        <h3>BRAF Mutation</h3>
                        <p>A mutation in the BRAF gene that activates the MAPK signaling pathway. BRAF V600E mutations are associated with poor prognosis and are an ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION criterion for LT in CRLM per IHPBA guidelines.</p>

                        <p>A mutation in the KRAS gene affecting growth signaling. Present in approximately 40% of colorectal cancers. KRAS mutations are associated with reduced response to anti-EGFR therapy but are not an exclusion criterion for LT.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Microsatellite Instability (MSI)</h3>
                        <p>A condition where DNA repair mechanisms are defective, leading to accumulation of mutations. MSI-high tumors are associated with poor prognosis in CRLM and are an EXCLUSION criterion for LT.</p>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>NRAS Mutation</h3>
                        <p>A mutation in the NRAS gene affecting growth signaling. Similar to KRAS mutations in prognostic significance. Not an exclusion criterion for LT but indicates need for careful patient selection.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>RAS/TP53 Co-mutations</h3>
                        <p>Concurrent mutations in both RAS genes (KRAS or NRAS) and TP53. Associated with significantly worse outcomes (median OS 21 months vs. 60 months without co-mutations). Patients should be carefully counseled about poor prognosis.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>TP53 Mutation</h3>
                        <p>A mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Present in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers. TP53 mutations alone are not an exclusion criterion, but RAS/TP53 co-mutations are associated with poor outcomes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glossary-term">
                        <h3>Wild-Type</h3>
                        <p>The normal, non-mutated form of a gene. For example, "BRAF wild-type" means the patient does not have a BRAF V600E mutation and is eligible for LT consideration.</p>

                        <h3>Efficacy</h3>
                        <p>The ability of a treatment to produce the desired effect. LT for CRLM has demonstrated efficacy in improving overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone.</p>
